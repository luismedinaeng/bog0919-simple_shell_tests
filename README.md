## **Synopsis**

In order to contribute to this repository, the test cases need to be done in one of two ways:

**1.** A file that checks if the output of the simple shell is correct through the use of a bash script, such as the one shown in:

**bog0919-simple_shell_tests/01_simple_shell_0.1/bin_ls**

**2**. As a textfile describing a task number, a command to test, an expected output, and any special condition that must be taken into account. 
Examples:

**Task:**
7. Simple shell 0.3

**Command to test:**  
$ ls  

**Expected output:**  
main1.c file1 file2  
$  

**Special Conditions:**

-Must work if PATH exists.  
-What would happen if the PATH is erased?  
-How would the PATH search change if instead of ls I try /bin/ls?
